Six Pillars of the Well-architected FrameworkHere are the six pillars of the Well-Architected Framework:

1.  - [Reliability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/reliability.html):** Ensuring a workload performs its intended function correctly and consistenly when it's expected to.
2.  **- [Performance efficiency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/performance-efficiency.html):** Optimizing resource utilization to minimize costs and maximize throughput.
3.  **- [Cost optimization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/cost-optimization.html):** Reducing unnecessary expenses without compromising performance or reliability.
4.  **- [Operational excellence](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/operational-excellence.html):** Automating tasks, monitoring system health, and improving overall operational effectiveness.
5.  **- [Security](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/security.html):** Protecting data and systems from unauthorized access and threats.
6.  **- [Sustainability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sustainability.html):** Minimizing the environmental  impacts of running cloud workloads
